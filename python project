Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Modules:
Tkinter: Used for creating GUI and drawing the clock face and hands.
time: Fetches the current time for the clock.
math: Used for trigonometric calculations to position clock hands.
Algorithms:
Uses basic trigonometric functions to calculate the position of clock hands based on the current time (hours, minutes, seconds).
Converts time into angles for accurate representation on the clock face.
